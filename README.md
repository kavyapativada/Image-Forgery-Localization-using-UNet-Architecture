# Image-Forgery-Localization-using-UNet-Architecture
Images are powerful tools that can convey a vast amount of information, often making a stronger impact than plain text. However, with the widespread availability of digital tools like Photoshop, Adobe After Effects, and AI algorithms, image manipulation and tampering have become increasingly common. This manipulation can significantly influence public opinion, impact elections, incite violence, and damage the reputations of individuals and organizations.

The goal is to develop a model capable of detecting the authenticity of an image and identifying the tampered portions. To achieve this, the UNet architecture is utilized.

**Dataset**: IEEE IFS-TC Image Forensics Challenge data  
(This dataset contains both authentic and manipulated images, with corresponding masks for each manipulated image that consist of only black and white pixels.)
